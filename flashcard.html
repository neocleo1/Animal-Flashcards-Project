                The pied-billed grebe is a small, brown waterbird known for its diving skills and ability to camouflage
                in aquatic vegetation. They are solitary birds, often found near marshy areas and have a distinct call
                resembling "cuck-cuck-cuck, cow-cow-cow". They build floating nests of vegetation and raise their young,
